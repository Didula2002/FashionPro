For bold looks, try complementary colors opposite on the wheel (purple/yellow). Analogous colors (blue/green) create harmony. Neutrals (black, white, beige, gray) work with everything.

This season, try pairing chocolate brown with bright orange, or sage green with lavender. I can create a personalized color palette for your wardrobe if you'd like!",
        "Advanced color coordination involves: understanding color temperature (warm vs cool), intensity (bright vs muted), and value (light vs dark). Monochromatic looks (different shades of one color) are always chic. For contrast, pair deep colors with pastels (navy with baby blue). Neutrals allow bold colors to shine. Metallics (gold, silver) serve as neutrals in evening wear. Your skin tone, hair color, and personal preferences should guide your palette.

This outfit works for office settings (with the jacket), lunch dates, or evening events. The wrap style flatters most body types and the print adds personality.

For scorching summers: opt for breathable linen or cotton in loose silhouettes, light colors that reflect heat, wide-brimmed hats for sun protection, and open-toe shoes. Freezing winters demand layering: start with thermal base layers, add insulating mid-layers like cashmere, top with a weatherproof outer shell. Rainy days require waterproof trench coats, rubber-bottom boots, and quick-dry fabrics. Transitional seasons are perfect for lightweight jackets, scarves, and versatile layers. What specific weather challenge are you facing?",
        "Seasonal dressing wisdom: Summer calls for moisture-wicking fabrics, UV-protective clothing, and ventilation (eyelet details, cut-outs). Winter prioritizes warmth retention - down insulation, wool blends, and windproof materials. Spring/fall are all about layering - think cardigans over sleeveless dresses, or light jackets with scarves. Rain demands water-repellent finishes (not just water-resistant), sealed seams, and quick-drying synthetics. Extreme cold requires attention to extremities - insulated gloves, thermal socks, and face protection. I can provide detailed packing lists or outfit formulas for any weather scenario you're preparing for!",

Pear shapes (wider hips than shoulders) look great in A-line skirts and dresses that skim the hips, with detailing on top to balance. Apple shapes (wider midsection) benefit from V-necks and empire waists that elongate the torso. Hourglass figures can emphasize their waist with belts and fitted styles. Petite frames should opt for vertical lines and monochromatic looks to create length. Tall individuals can carry bold prints and maxi lengths beautifully. Share your shape and I'll provide customized recommendations!",
        "Flattering your unique figure starts with understanding proportions. For athletic builds with less waist definition, create curves with peplum tops, ruffles, and belted styles. Plus-size figures shine in well-tailored pieces with strategic draping - avoid shapeless sacks. Petite women should look for cropped lengths and small-scale prints. Tall frames can experiment with bold patterns and oversized silhouettes. The key is focusing on fit rather than size numbers - quality tailoring makes all the difference. Would you like me to suggest specific brands known for flattering your particular body type?",

General guidelines: highlight your favorite feature (if you love your legs, show them off), create waist definition even if it's not naturally pronounced, balance proportions (if you're top-heavy, wear darker colors up top), and always prioritize comfort. Certain universal rules apply: properly fitted undergarments create smooth lines, vertical details elongate, and monochromatic looks are slimming. But remember - confidence is your best accessory!

Layer with an [oversized blazer] or [chunky cardigan] depending on formality needs. Footwear could range from [loafers] to [ankle boots]. Accessorize with [minimalist gold jewelry] and a [structured tote]. This look transitions beautifully from work to evening by swapping the top layer and adding bold lip color.

        "Today's outfit inspiration combines comfort and style: Try a [midi wrap dress] in a solid color with [ankle boots] and a [leather jacket] for transitional weather. Add [opaque tights] if chilly. Carry a [crossbody bag] for hands-free convenience. This look works for office settings (add blazer), lunch dates, or errands. The wrap silhouette flatters most figures while allowing movement. For cooler evenings, layer with a [cashmere wrap]. Would you like variations based on your wardrobe contents or specific activities planned?",
        "Based on seasonal appropriateness, I recommend: [Dark wash skinny jeans] paired with a [chunky knit sweater] in an autumnal hue. Layer with a [trench coat] and [riding boots] for classic fall style. Accessorize with a [blanket scarf] and [hoop earrings]. This outfit balances warmth and style, perfect for crisp days. The proportions create a streamlined silhouette while the textures add visual interest. For evening, swap the sweater for a [silky blouse] and add heeled booties.
